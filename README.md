# Neural Network
 Made with c++ without dependencies

## MPL
MLP for generic use. It can be used in any context where the network does not need to return integer or floating point values.
The network returns a vector(also known as an array) of booleans

# Reason
I made it with the intention of learning and using it in small future projects.
